## Fréchet Video Distance helper (`fvd_metric`)

- **Source**: [ragor114/PyTorch-Frechet-Video-Distance](https://github.com/ragor114/PyTorch-Frechet-Video-Distance)
- **Upstream description**: PyTorch reimplementation of the Fréchet Video Distance metric, adapted from StyleGAN-V to process in-memory tensors.
- **License status**: As of 2025-11-23, the upstream repository does **not** publish an explicit license file. All code remains © the original author(s). Usage should be limited to internal evaluation unless explicit permission is obtained from the upstream maintainers.
- **Citation request**: The README asks users to cite the original FVD paper (Unterthiner et al.), StyleGAN-V (Skorokhodov et al.), and DIGAN (Yu et al.) when reporting results built on this metric.

If the upstream project publishes a formal license in the future, update this notice and include the license text verbatim in this directory.
